## NetSendPro


</div>

### Description

This neat little programm reads all Computers enlisted on an network, then it lists them and you can send netsend messages to all or choosen. The code is simple and self explaining so there isn't too much commenting in it. The programm is working well and is in life action in my company.

Makes use of the NetServerEnum and NetUserEnum API, so if someone interested in this he should have a look on this source. Have fun.
